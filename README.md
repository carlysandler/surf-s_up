# surfs_up
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval with `Jupyter Notebook`, `SQLite` and `SQLAlchemy`

## CHALLENGE BACKGROUND
Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June (40 points)
Deliverable 1 Instructions
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

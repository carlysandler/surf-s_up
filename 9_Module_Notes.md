# Module 9:Notes
## WEATHER ANALYSIS OF OAHU, HI FOR PROSPECTIVE SURF SHOP INVESTOR
	*Time Sensitive: Deliverables of results and weather analysis require completion before quarterly board meeting*
	# GOAL: Provide W. Avy insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where potential suf shop will be built.
# 9.2.2 - Save Query Results
## In order to have easy access to results, need to put them

## 1. Create DataFrame variable, `df`, which we can use to save our query.
	# __Note__: In order to save results, we need to:
		# 1. Provide our results variable as one parameter
		# 2. Specify column names as second parameter
## 2. Use the `set_index()` Function
	# __Note__: First column is autogenerated and contains row number
		# 1. Set index to date column - making it 1st column
		# 2. Use variable `inplace` specify y/n create a new df
	# `df.set_index(df['date], inplace=True)
## 3. Print the DataFrame With and Without the Index
	# `print(df)` - with index
	# without index
		# __Note__: two date columns generated (index=date) -> confusing. Print without index to just see date & precipitation
		# 1. Convert the DataFrame to strings
		# 2. Set out index to "False"
	# print(df.to_string(index=False`)) 

# 9.2.3 - Sort the DataFrame : Fix chronological order of dates

# 1.  Create a plot of preciptation scores in chronological order
# Show how much it rained on a given day and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days too
# Sort the values by date using the `sort_index() function`
# Previously set the index to the date column, now can use new index to sort results.

9.2.4 - Plot the Data
One way to provide this insight is with a visualization—we'll plot the results of our precipitation analysis using Matplotlib.

Along the x-axis are the dates from our dataset, and the y-axis is the total amount of precipitation for each day. While this data shows all of the station observations, we are interested in determining weather trends. One trend we can observe based on this plot is that some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others. Awesome—this observation confirms that the plot is useful. W. Avy is going to love it!

Next, we want to create a summary of a few statistics, and then we can send W. Avy an email with our initial findings. Be sure to tell W. Avy that this plot shows the total precipitation per day.

9.2.5 - Generate the Summary

In addition to the plot we just made, we want to make sure to provide W. Avy with some solid statistical analysis—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. He needs hard results if he's going to invest his money.

# REWIND:
# Here's a refresher on some key concepts in statistics:

# Mean: the average, which you can find by adding up all the numbers in a dataset and dividing by the number of numbers.
# Variance: how far a set of numbers is from the average.
# Standard deviation: a measure of how spread out numbers in a dataset are; the square root of the variance.
Minimum: the smallest number in a dataset.
Maximum: the largest number in a dataset.
Percentiles: where the number is in relation to the rest of the set of data.
Count: the total number of numbers or items in a dataset.

This data gives us a summary of different statistics for the amount of precipitation in a year. The count is the number of times precipitation was observed. The other statistics are the precipitation amounts for each station for each day.
